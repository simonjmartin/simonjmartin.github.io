            <h1>How does Ninjutsu compare to other martial arts?</h1>
            <p><img src="images/fighting.jpg" alt="An early photo of Takamatsu Sensei teaching the Rokushaku Bo" width="278" height="204" class="featureImgRight"> Most martial arts that we are familiar with today are rather new;  developed either during or after the Meiji Period (1867-1912) to be enjoyed as sports or for spiritual refinement. Even though they are oriented towards actual fighting or combat, they are not sufficient for life or death fights - but then, that was not the goal. It is important to remember that Dr Kano developed Judo as a sport to introduce to the schools, Funakoshi did the same with Karate, and Ueshiba developed Aikido as a means of self-improvement and spiritual enlightenment. Having said that, this does not mean that these arts are ineffective, merely that they were refined from ancient Samurai combat systems to have a different and sometimes very specific focus </p>
            
            <p>Ninjutsu, in contrast, is a broad-based ancient martial art that developed through more than a thousand years of actual combat experience. <a href="ninpo_ninjutsu.html">Ninpo</a> Taijutsu (Ninjutsu) and the other styles taught in the <a href="genbukan.html">Genbukan</a> system are with us today because they survived in the midst of actual fighting and did not die out on the battlefield. The techniques did not go through a period of change to make the art more "sport-like". Because Ninjutsu, as it is taught today, maintains the combat-effective techniques it is often said to be the art of survival, the art of winning.</p>
