            <h1 lang="ja">Seika Dojo - Genbukan Ninpo Dojo</h1>
            <p>Seika Dojo teaches the martial art traditions and techniques of <a href="sensei.html"> Grandmaster Shoto Tanemura</a> and is an official Dojo of the <span lang="ja"><a href="genbukan.html">Genbukan</a></span> World Ninpo Bugei Federation.</p>
            
            <p><span class="boldText">Classes are held in Canterbury, suitable for beginners 16 and older, every Tuesday 7:30pm - 8:30pm</span>. For more information please contact <a href="contact.html"> Dojo Cho Simon Martin</a>.</p>
            
            <p><span lang="ja">Ninpo Bugei Taijutsu</span> is a Japanese Martial Art that has its origins some 1000 years ago. It has been renowned for its self-protection techniques and the comprehensive nature of its martial arts training which has always emphasized and integrated physical, mental and spiritual elements.</p>
            
            <p>Both the Genbukan and the <abbr title="Kokusai Ju Jutsu Remnei"><a href="kjjr.html">K.J.J.R.</a></abbr> are international organizations founded by Grandmaster Tanemura. His federations ensure the credibility of instruction and the ranks of all its members. All instructors are personally certified by Grandmaster Tanemura.</p>
            
            <p>Tanemura Sensei gives names to all registered <span lang="ja">Genbukan</span> and KJJR dojo's and he has chosen <span lang="ja">Seika</span> Dojo (which means Sacred Fire) as the name for this dojo.</p>
                        
            <p>The physical training taught by the <span lang="ja">Genbukan</span> is focused on the use of <span lang="ja">Tai-sabaki</span>, or the use of refined body movement to facilitate the skilful use of self-protection techniques, as opposed to using techniques which rely solely on muscular strength. Training is usually conducted with students working with partners so that they can develop correct timing, distancing, and body mechanics. Since the training is skill oriented, and not strength oriented, it has proven itself to be highly effective means of handling a confrontation with larger and stronger opponents and while natural speed and strength decline with age constantly practiced skills will improve over time.</p>
            <p>Please note that no attempt to perform any of the techniques shown on this, or any other website, should be made without the supervision of a <a href="http://www.genbukan.org/Amatsu_Tatara_Martial_Art_and_/Instructor_Certificate/instructor_certificate.html" target="_blank" title="Link opens in a new browser window">qualified (<span lang="ja">Genbukan</span>/KJJR) instructor</a>; and all injuries that may follow are the sole responsibility of the individuals concerned.</p>
